# -Image-Classification-for-Industrial-Equipment-Defect-Detection
In this project the model designed to categorize images of industrial machinery as either "defective" or "non-defective." The main objective was to develop a precise classification system capable of identifying defects, which can potentially be integrated into quality control processes within industrial environments
